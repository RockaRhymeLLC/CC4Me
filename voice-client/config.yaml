# BMO Voice Client Configuration

# Daemon connection
daemon:
  host: "192.168.12.169"   # Mac Mini (BMO)
  port: 3847

# Client identity
client:
  id: "laptop-01"
  callback_port: 3849      # Port for daemon-initiated requests (chime)

# Wake word
wake_word:
  # Path to custom model file, or a pre-trained model name (e.g., "hey_jarvis")
  model: "hey_bee_mo.onnx"
  threshold: 0.5            # Detection confidence threshold (0.0-1.0)
  inference_framework: "onnx"
  patience: 2               # Consecutive frames above threshold needed (filters noise spikes)
  vad_threshold: 0.5        # Silero VAD threshold — filters non-speech sounds (0 = disabled)

# Audio
audio:
  sample_rate: 16000        # Must be 16kHz for openWakeWord and whisper
  channels: 1               # Mono
  frame_size: 1280          # 80ms at 16kHz — openWakeWord native frame size
  silence_threshold: 500    # Energy threshold for silence detection
  silence_duration: 1.0     # Seconds of silence before stopping recording
  max_recording: 30.0       # Maximum recording duration in seconds

# Playback
playback:
  volume: 1.0               # Output volume multiplier (0.0-1.0)

# Conversation mode
conversation:
  follow_up_duration: 10.0   # Seconds to listen for follow-up (longer for Telegram latency)
  enable_stop_interrupt: false # Disabled — mic picks up speaker audio and false-triggers

# Push-to-talk (hold key to speak without wake word)
push_to_talk:
  enabled: true
  key: "right_cmd"           # Options: right_cmd, right_alt, right_ctrl, f18, etc.

# Heartbeat
heartbeat:
  interval: 30              # Seconds between heartbeats to daemon
