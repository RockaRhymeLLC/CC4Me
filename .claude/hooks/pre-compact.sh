# PreCompact Hook (v2.1)
#
# Key insight: Claude has the context, this hook doesn't.
# Instead of writing a generic placeholder, we output an instruction
# that tells Claude to save its own state — which will be much more
# useful since Claude knows what it was working on.
#
# v2.1: Also creates a timestamped backup of any existing assistant-state.md
# so we never lose a previous save even if Claude doesn't write a new one
# before compaction completes.
#
# Fires on: manual (/compact), auto (context full)

CRITICAL: Context compaction is about to happen. You are about to lose most of your conversation context.

IMMEDIATELY write your current state to .claude/state/assistant-state.md with:
1. **Current Task**: What you're working on right now (be specific)
2. **Progress**: What you've completed so far (files changed, decisions made)
3. **Next Steps**: Exactly what to do next when you resume
4. **Key Context**: Any important details that would be lost (variable names, error messages, user preferences expressed in this session)
5. **Open Questions**: Anything you were uncertain about

Then check /todo list and update any in-progress todos.

This is your last chance to preserve context before compaction. Be thorough.
