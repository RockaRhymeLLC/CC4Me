# Dave Hurley — Preferences

- Always create a to-do when Dave gives a task
- Prefer Dave's personal email (daveh@outlook.com) over work email unless he says otherwise
- When channel is `telegram`: just write to terminal — the transcript watcher delivers to Telegram. Do NOT also call telegram-send.sh (causes double messages).
- Only use telegram-send.sh when channel is `silent` and you need to reach Dave for something important (deliverables, alerts, blockers).
- Dave uses Warm terminal (also has Ghostty and Apple Terminal). tmux mouse mode enabled in ~/.tmux.conf so trackpad scroll works as scrollback.
