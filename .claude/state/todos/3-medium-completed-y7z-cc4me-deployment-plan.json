(2) Upstream contribution strategy — 5 logical PRs (session persistence, email, telegram, scheduled jobs, documentation). (3) Will's homework checklist — software installs, accounts to create, credentials to gather, email provider options. (4) Deployment walkthrough — 8-step guide from clone to test. (5) README/SETUP.md update plan — proposed new structure covering all features. (6) Open questions for Dave and Will. Saved to .claude/state/research/cc4me-deployment-plan.md"
