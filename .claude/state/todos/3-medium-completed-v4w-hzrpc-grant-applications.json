      "note": "Created 3 Word documents: (1) BCF Stronger Neighborhoods draft application with full narrative, budget template, and attachments checklist — strongest fit, March 25 deadline. (2) Ravens PLAY 60 draft application with two program options, measurable goals, and budget — opens April 2026. (3) Guidance notes for Good Sports (eligibility inquiry email included) and DICK'S Sports Matter (invitation-only, sign up recommended). Research covered all four programs plus Good Sports and DICK'S as alternatives. Maryland DNR and HB1275 were not viable (HB1275 never passed legislature). Emailed all 3 files to daveh@outlook.com via Fastmail."
