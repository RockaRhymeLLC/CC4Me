  "description": "Dave is trying to get API access to the bmo@bmobot.ai email (M365 Exchange account provisioned through GoDaddy). The Microsoft Entra admin UI keeps redirecting to GoDaddy's admin settings. Need to research:\n- Can GoDaddy-provisioned M365 accounts access Entra/Azure AD directly?\n- How to get API keys (Microsoft Graph API) for GoDaddy M365 accounts\n- Is this a paid feature GoDaddy locks down?\n- Workarounds or alternatives\n\nSave research to a file for later discussion.",

Best path is defederation (official Microsoft process, no data loss). Quick workarounds to try first: portal.azure.com directly, or PowerShell app registration."
