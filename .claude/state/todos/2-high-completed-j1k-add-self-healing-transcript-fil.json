  "description": "The transcript watcher can get stuck tailing a stale transcript file when a new Claude session starts. Add periodic checking so the watcher detects newer .jsonl files in the transcript directory and switches to them automatically.\n\nApproach:\n- In the watcher's main loop, periodically check if a newer .jsonl file exists\n- If found, switch to tailing the new file\n- Log the switchover",
