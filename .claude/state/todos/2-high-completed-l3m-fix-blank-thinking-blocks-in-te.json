  "title": "Fix blank thinking blocks in Telegram watcher output",
  "description": "The transcript watcher is detecting thinking blocks and sending them to Telegram even when not in verbose mode, but sending them as blank/empty messages. Need to:\n- Ensure thinking blocks are only sent when channel is telegram-verbose\n- Never send empty/blank messages to Telegram\n- Check the process_line logic for the thinking block handling",

The thinking block logic was already correct (only sends on telegram-verbose), but the text extraction was picking up the '(no content)' placeholder that Claude Code writes when a turn has only thinking/tool use."
