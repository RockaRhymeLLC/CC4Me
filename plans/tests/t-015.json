  "result": "PARTIAL — code verified. (1) _voice_interaction_loop supports follow-up: after playback, listens for follow_up_duration (3s default) for speech. (2) If speech detected, processes as new query without wake word. (3) If silence, returns to idle. (4) One level of follow-up per wake word cycle. Full test needs laptop with mic/speakers."
