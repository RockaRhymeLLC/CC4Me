  "result": "PARTIAL — tested full flow on Mac Mini with mock client. (1) Client registered, status shows connected. (2) POST /voice/notify triggers chime to client callback. (3) Mock client confirms chime. (4) TTS synthesizes 176KB WAV. (5) Audio pushed to client /play endpoint. Result: delivered=true, method=voice. Steps 3-5 (actual chime sound + human confirmation) need laptop with speakers/mic."
